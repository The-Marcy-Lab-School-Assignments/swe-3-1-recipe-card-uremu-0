                Instructions
                <ol>Prepare the Plantains: Peel the green plantains and cut them into 1-inch thick wheels. Optionally,
                    soak them in salted water for 15 minutes, then pat them completely dry.</ol>
                <ol>Fry the Plantains: Heat about 2 inches of oil in a skillet to 350°F (175°C). Fry the plantain slices
                    until they are golden and tender (about 4–7 minutes per side), but do not let them brown or become
                    too crispy, as they must remain soft enough to mash.</ol>
                <ol>Mash the Base: In a large mortar and pestle (pilón), crush the garlic with a little olive oil and
                    salt to form a paste.</ol>
                <ol>Combine and Mash: Add the fried plantains and crushed pork cracklings to the mortar in batches. Mash
                    thoroughly until the mixture is well-combined and starchy, similar to chunky mashed potatoes.</ol>
                <ol>Adjust Consistency: If the mixture is too dry or tough, add a few tablespoons of warm chicken broth
                    or extra olive oil until it reaches a cohesive, moist consistency.
                </ol>
                <ol>Shape and Serve: Pack the mixture into a small bowl or the mortar to form a dome shape, then flip it
                    onto a plate. Serve immediately while warm, often accompanied by chicken broth or topped with
                    shrimp, chicken, or fried pork (carne frita). </ol>
